we are doing logistic management system using react and python
the usecases we are using are
"sending product" by the user to the warehouse
"receiving products" to the inventory, where we check the type of the product, quality and quantity
then we approve the product for sending it to "storing inventory" usecase, where we label the products based on if its "e-prod or automobile or clothes or staples" and and organize them and , we pack them with the from, to address and date of delivery and store them in any of 10  inventoris in our warehouse(1 for each county)
then we enter "monitroing inventory" which is basically graph and chart to visualize our inventory and provide some statistical data about the products we have
then after storing in inventory, we assign the date, time and mode of transport
finally after reaching destination we enter usecase "notify" customer 


now we need to simulate this using react python and flask
especially we need to use oop, databse

give proper sketch on using all the usecases and simulating all things i mentioned..
